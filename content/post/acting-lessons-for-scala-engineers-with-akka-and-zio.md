In November 2020 I had the great privilege to do a [Talk at Scale By The Bay Conference](https://scalebythebay2020.sched.com/event/e54O/acting-lessons-for-scala-engineers-with-akka-and-zio).

### Here is the recording of my talk

### I also wrote three blogs posts as a companion to my talk

[Introduction to the Actor Model](http://localhost:1313/post/introduction-to-the-actor-model/)

[Introduction to Akka Typed Using Scala](http://localhost:1313/post/introduction-to-akka-typed-using-scala/)
