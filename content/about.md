I, [Salar Rahmanian](https://www.softinio.com), am a software engineer based in San Francisco Bay Area, California.

I have been developing software since the age of eleven. My current passion is functional programming, big data and distributed systems. 

I am particularly enthusiastic about the Scala Programming language and NixOS and technologies such as Kafka, Spark and Akka. 

I try to make open source contributions when I can. I have contributed to the [ZIO](https://zio.dev) ecosystem, most notably leading and creating the [ZIO-Actors](https://zio.github.io/zio-actors/) and [ZIO-zmx](https://zio.github.io/zio-zmx/) projects.

I am also organizer for a few meetup groups and arrange technical talk events. To find out more about them and join our community visit [SF Bay Area Techies](https://wwww.sfbayareatechies.com).
