At this meetup we watched a video on frontend development using Scala and
scala.js recorded at this years Scaladays. The presenter [Otto
Chrons](https://twitter.com/ochrons?lang=en) gave a humourous and inspiring
talk on this topic and introduced us to his new UI framework
[Suzaku](https://github.com/suzaku-io/suzaku). By the way he is looking for
contributors to this project so if you are looking for an open source scala
project to contribute to this would be a great one. 

If you want to watch the video it can be found here:

After the video we had discussions about scala.js and a few of the attendees
went to the scala.js documentation and created a hello world program using it
to get familiar with it. It was great fun and in future meetups we are thinking
of doing more learning and coding activities to learn scala.js as a group.

If anyone knows me personally they know that I am a big fan of vim as my text
editor. So lately I have been doing 90% of my scala coding using vim and
[ensime](http://ensime.org/). So I did a demo of how I have setup
[neovim](https://neovim.io/) and how I use it. 

For anyone who attended the meetup and is keen to have the same setup my
dotfiles can be found here:

It was great to see everyone who attended, hope to see more scala types at our
next event:
