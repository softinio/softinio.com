# Sponsoring a Meetup #
I run 4 meetups in DC Tech community with the purpose of creating a community
where attendees learn from each other, share experiences and motivate each
other to sharpen their technical skills finding time for that side project.

As these events are not run for profit we need a venue to meet and some food
and drinks for our members. So we look to sponsors to provide these in exchange
for the sponsor being able to promote their brand or offering at the start of
the meetup.
