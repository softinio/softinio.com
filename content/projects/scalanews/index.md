# Overview

I wanted to create a directory of all bloggers who write about Scala Programming language with links to their RSS Feeds.

Using this directory I have created a CLI tool using Scala, Typelevel stack (cats-effect, fs2, http4s, decline, Laika) to use the rss feed links to generate the latest news in the scala community that I publish periodically on [www.scalanews.net](https://www.scalanews.net/).
