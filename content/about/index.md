I, [Salar Rahmanian](https://www.softinio.com), am a software engineer based in San Francisco Bay Area, California.

I have been developing software since the age of eleven. My current passion is functional programming, big data and distributed systems. 

I am particularly enthusiastic about the Scala Programming language and NixOS and technologies such as Apache Nifi, Kafka, Spark and Akka / Pekko. 

I contribute to open source projects when time allows. 

At work, I am currently working as a Data Engineer using spark and Databricks alot. For full details of my experience have a look at my [Resume](/resume).

As a long term Vim user and Neovim fan I also have started contributing plugins written in Lua for Neovim.
