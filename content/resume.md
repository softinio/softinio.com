### Senior Principal Engineer, Snagajob — 2016-2018 ###
I built a new data ingestion pipeline to ingest high volume of job postings received from multiple sources and partners. I built this using Scala, akka, akka-http, Play Framework, Kafka and Apache Nifi. I also setup a Kubernetes cluster running on AWS which was used for this new ingestion pipeline. I was responsible for introducing all these wonderful technologies to Snagajob.

Other projects I was involved in at Snagajob involved me creating micro services and REST api’s using Python, Flask, Celery.

### Senior Full Stack Software Engineer, Trackmaven — 2015-2016 ###
Enhanced Trackmaven’s competitive intelligence platform by creating new services using Python, Flask, Django, Elasticsearch and PostgreSQL. Created a new UI Dashboard used by customers to track marketing campaign performance versus their competitor using Angular.

I worked on the modernization of the Dept of Veteran Affairs eHmp health care system. I was the technical lead of a team of 10 responsible for the development of the platforms sync system. This was a distributed system used to sync patient records across all hospitals. The main stack I used for development was Java, Spring, Dropwizard and Node.js.

### Chief Technology Officer, Healthy Choices At Work — 2012-2014 ###
I was a hands on CTO and Engineer at this startup. I architected and developed a custom CRM system for the business. This provided a full end to end solution which allowed customers to sign up for the service and manage their own accounts.

### Principal Software Engineer, Powermax Computing Ltd — 1998-2009 ###
If you have worked in the UK as an experienced software developer, you realize that the best jobs from all angles are contract / consultant positions. So during this period whilst living in London UK i worked for many well known companies on the biggest projects as a Principal Software Engineer. In the early years my work solely involved coding using  C Programming on a Unix Platform (such as Solaris and AIX) with an Oracle Database backend (included Pro*C and PL/SQL). 

In the more later years my coding was mostly done using Java, Spring, Hibernate and Oracle again as the database backend.

The companies I worked for included: O2, IBM, Oracle, National Car Rental.

### Education ###
- King’s College, University of London — BEng(Hons) in Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Graduated in 1992
- École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne on Coursera — [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/H5W964KAJ73Y)

### Projects ###

I contribute to various Scala open source projects. Most notabiliy to Scala [ZIO](https://zio.dev/) library and group of projects. My main focus and contribution is working on and leading the [ZIO-Actors](https://zio.github.io/zio-actors/) library. A high performance, purely-functional library for building and supervising typed actors backed by ZIO. A Fresh approach to implementing the actor model.

I am also working on and leading [ZIO-Zmx](https://github.com/zio/zio-zmx) a new project that is a work in progress providing monitoring and metrics of ZIO fibers.
